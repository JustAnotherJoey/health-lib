# Health
Personal health is an aspect of life that everyone has to deal with and everyone will have a different approach to. With that being said, I strive to provide both simplified, heuristic based approaches combined with quantatative, scientific based approaches for folks who have similar goals and values as I do. In the broadest sense possible,  my personal health goals are to find the optimal balance of longevity and performance. I want to feel great physically, mentally, and emotionally. I want to have a sharp mind, great endurance, strength, emotional discipline, flexibility, and fortitude. My goal is to put myself in the best position to have sustained superior performance for as long as possible.
