# Health
Personal health is an aspect of life that everyone has to deal with and everyone will have a different approach to. With that being said, I strive to provide both simplified, heuristic based approaches combined with quantatative, scientific based approaches for folks who have similar goals and values as I do. In the broadest sense possible,  my personal health goals are to find the optimal balance of longevity and performance. I want to feel great physically, mentally, and emotionally. I want to have a sharp mind, great endurance, strength, emotional discipline, flexibility, and fortitude. My goal is to put myself in the best position to have sustained superior performance for as long as possible. 

## Nutrition
Nutrition does not need to be that complicated in order to see good results. On the other hand, if you take your personal health and athletic performance seriously, it may be valuable to take the time to understand what goes into personal nutrition. I have two seperate approaches, one being a mostly heuristic approach that has worked for me, and a quantatative approach that tries to key into ones physiological profile, current health goals, and current health background in order to get feedback that is more tuned to an individual's circumstances. This means understanding what your macronutrient and micronutrient requirements/guidelines should be for your biometrics (height, age, weight, genetic profile, blood profile, etc).

## Mental Health
Since I am not very knowledgable in this realm, I will try and keep this section fairly short. I believe that mental health starts with having a purpose in life that you care about, healthy relationships with your family and friends, and maintaining balance with your responsibilities. In my opinion, there are some things outside of your control that can lead to a lot of stress or unhappiness. Although I would like to learn more ways in which I can fortify my mental health, I have personally found that adopting a Stoic attitude to pain and suffering coupled with purposeful, regular communication with my familiy and friends to be a great way of finding myself in a peaceful state of mind. 

- "Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself"
- Be grateful since things can always get much worse
- Find a purpose and way of life that works for you

I have found that meditation is a helpful practice for me to switch activities, especially after I have just exercised or did something stressful. For me, meditating is as simple as putting your body in a good position to breathe, closing your eyes, and focusing on your breathing for 10 minutes or however long works for you.
